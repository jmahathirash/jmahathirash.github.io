# Rock Paper Scissors
​
Hello there, This is a rock, paper, scissors game made with javascript, html, jquery and css. Of course using everyone's favorite actor, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!! It will tell you what choice the computer chooses, whether you win or lose, and keeps score! This game was made as a Project for a program that I attended.

### Mandatory to Pass Requirements
​Your game must meet these requirements:

1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery (this game will be played using the DOM, not the console)
2. Hosted on github pages
3. Commits to github every day
4. A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Game must have:
1. Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
* Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer
* Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns

2. A win state - a way for the player to win the game 
* High score can be considered a win state

3. A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
* Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
* Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left

4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over

5. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost
* Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll
* Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
